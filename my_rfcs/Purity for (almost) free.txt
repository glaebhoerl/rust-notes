## Purity for (almost) free
  "Ask not what you can do for purity, but what purity can do for you"
 - requires changing very little
 - the language / type system already has everything we need!!
 - the goal is only to know what functions _can't_ do
 - what we choose to require is that bare functions and closures with immutable environments can't do IO without having an IO permission passed in
 - we achieve this by passing around IO capabilities/permissions, which can only be duplicated given unique/mutable access
 - in other words IO caps can be passed either by-move or (implicitly) cloned from &mut borrows, but are neither Copy nor Clone
   - need to be careful that `static mut`s don't allow any way to subvert it!
 - philosophical justification:
   TODO! consider the general case (not just closures but &mut references and existential quantification, private types, etc. in general)
   (but feels like it should be fine)
   - Haskell doesn't _have_ anything other than immutable values and closures with immutable environments
   - => therefore, even if only closures with immutable environments are pure in Rust, we're at least as good as Haskell
   - GHC's IO monad is defined as `State# RealWorld -> (# State# RealWorld, a #)`
     or without the noise: `World -> (World, a)`
     State#/World must be used linearly, but GHC can't enforce it: therefore needs to hide it behind an abstract `IO` type
   - => but Rust does have linear/affine types!
   - Clean has linear/affine/uniqueness types, so it exposes World directly, with the IO wrapper only for convenience
   - World is linear/affine because Haskell and Clean are lazily evaluated, and need to enforce an execution order for IO operations
   - => but Rust is strictly evaluated, so there's no need for this! (it comes for free)
   - in Clean and Haskell, State#/World has two purposes:
     * enforce an execution order, and
     * make sure you can only do IO if you've been granted access to the State#/World
   - => in Rust, we only need the latter!
   - => therefore: we can allow `State`/`World`/`IO`/whatever to be cloneable if you have unique access
   - can think of it as `&mut RealWorld`, i.e. a mutable reference to The Outside World
   - normally `&mut T` is non-cloneable, to enforce unique access to the referent
   - but having unique access to The Outside World is impossible by definition!
   - => therefore, there's no point to forbidding it from being cloneable
 - the type system does not have to change at all
 - no effect typing, no effect polymorphism, just passing around IO caps in arguments
 - could do it entirely in library code (calling `fn dup(&mut IO) -> IO`)
 - only need language support to make it convenient (dup/pass it automatically)
 - all closures with mutable or owned environments are untouched
 - all function calls are untouched
 - only "top-level" function types which actually do IO need to be changed to take an IO cap
   - immutable closures, trait objects, and `fn` pointers need to take an `IO` cap, if they do IO
   - how many of these are there?
 - Cell, RefCell, and other "interior mutability" things need to take IO caps for their methods
   - QUESTION! if Cell takes IO cap in constructor and stores it instead, is that bad? why?
   - ANSWER! even if stored, couldn't use it from an & borrow! so this is not a hole.
 - traits are also mostly untouched, or improved
 - e.g. Eq, Ord, Clone _shouldn't_ do IO
 - for Iterator, iterators which do IO can store an IO cap, and next() takes &mut self so they can use it
 - types like Reader and Writer could either take an IO cap in their constructors and store it, or take an IO cap on each method
   - if the destructor does IO, they probably need to take it in the constructor and store it?
   - this is probably a better + more convenient design anyway
 - main() gets passed an IO cap at program start
 - and of course have an `unsafe fn unsafe_io() -> IO`
 - `debug!()`, etc. are exempt
 - the only hard part is figuring out sugar for implicitly passing (&mut-cloning) the IO cap, and/or whether to implement it as some kind of general mechanism
   - type-based? (declare that `struct IO` is always passed implicitly)
   - function-based? (allow declaring function args which are passed implicitly)
     - like GHC's ImplicitParams?
     - or search the calling context, pass implicitly if exactly 1 value of matching type is in scope, or if at least 1 is && type is zero-sized?
     - (like Scala implicits... ?)
   - just hard-wire it?
     - => probably the best choice for now?
     - still need to figure out syntax 
       - `fn print(s: &str, use IO);`
         - `fn print_with(s: &str, printer: fn(&str, use IO))`
       - `fn print(s: &str) effect IO;`
         - `fn print_with(s: &str, printer: fn(&str) effect IO)`
       - `fn print(s: &str) do IO;`
         - `fn print_with(s: &str, printer: fn(&str) do IO)`
       - `fn print(s: &str) does IO;`
         - `fn print_with(s: &str, printer: fn(&str) does IO)`
   - CONSTRAINT: Should work for closures i.e. trait objects in general! (&mut FnMut...)
   - CONSTRAINT: Should also work for e.g. STM cap?
   - type-based is the only one which obviously satisfies these!
   - impl Env/Capability/... for IO/STM/... { }?
     - built-in trait
     - have a method `dup(&mut self) -> Self`? or `dup(self) -> (Self, Self)`?
     - `&mut` entails `let mut`, `&uniq` would be more appropriate
     - the second version also only works with `let mut` or if you make new `let`s each time...
     - but alternative is just compiler magic (which is involved anyway)
     - so then: `&Fn(int, IO)`? or special syntax? what/how? probably: this is fine
 - and potentially extending it to a hierarchy of caps:
   - effects observable only:
     * within this function: `let mut` etc., language already guarantees this
     * within this task: {,Ref}Cell, TLS
     * within this process: Arc, Atomic, spawn(), channel(), send() etc.
     * the whole "outside world": println!, std::io etc.
   - allows e.g. starting tasks which cannot do external IO, only internal communication
   - would require a system for implicitly translating caps to sub-caps (explicitly would be too painful, e.g. have IO, want to use Cell)
     - impl SubCapOf<IO> for Comm?
     - this doesn't actually seem too bad, if it works
   - how much do we want this? Haskell only has IO.
   - => it's probably simpler to just have IO.
        could the others be added backwards-compatibly?
 Use cases:
  * debug_assert!() => OK!
  * Cell[Copy->Clone] => OK!
  * STM => OK!
  * Lazy<T> => OK!
  * FRP => seems OK!
  * rewrite rules?
  * parallelization?
  * supercompilation?!
 QUESTION would this also help with e.g. "cleanness" of pattern matching via `Deref`*? 
   definitely for plain `Deref`, maybe less so for `DerefMut`
   but would likely get benefit across the board w/ mutability polymorphism formulation!
 Q: "But what about logging?!"
 A: "Just pass in a (mut reference to the) logger!" (you should do this anyways)
 Q: "What about random number generation?"
 A: probably the same thing. boohoo.
 "purity" just boils down to not being able to access global mutable state?
.


### ACTUAL PROPOSAL:

#[lang(capability)]
pub trait Capability: sizeof(Self) = 0 {
    type Super: Capability = Self;
}

// magical wired-in:
pub fn dup<Cap: Capability>(cap: &uniq Cap)        -> Cap;
pub fn sub<Cap: Capability>(sup: &uniq Cap::Super) -> Cap;

// possibly exposed:
pub fn {dup, sub} as above, except: &mut Cap, or Cap -> (Cap, Cap)

LANGUAGE DEF:
Whenever 
 * A function expects an argument of type `Cap` where `Cap: Capability` as its last argument, and
 * The argument is omitted by the caller, then:
 * If a value of type `Cap` is available in the caller's context, it is implicitly `dup()`ed, or
 * If `Cap::Super` != `Cap` and a value of type `Cap::Super` is available, then it is implicitly `sub()`ed,
 * (Keep doing this until `Cap::Super` = `Cap`),
 * Then the result is implicitly passed in place of the omitted argument.
"Available in the caller's context" means:
 * In an argument, let, or match binding
 * Look into struct and tuple fields, but don't call `fn`s (obviously)
 * What about deref? Derefing `&mut` should be OK, if it's an issue; probably not user types.
 * Don't need to be complete, just convenient.

pub unsafe fn unsafe_cap<Cap: Capability>() -> Cap;
// or per-type?

pub struct Mut  { marker: NoCopy } // affects task
pub struct Comm { marker: NoCopy } // affects process
pub struct IO   { marker: NoCopy } // affects world
// TODO: bikeshed names
// (alternative (dual) naming scheme: Capability -> Environment, Mut -> Task, Comm -> Process, IO -> World)
// (seems more logical & consistent, but less intuitive & self-descriptive)

impl Capability for Mut  { type Super = Comm; }
impl Capability for Comm { type Super = IO;   }
impl Capability for IO   {                    }

LANGUAGE DEF:
 * Functions which do not have unique access to any Cap must be pure.
   TODO make this precise w.r.t. arguments, &, &mut, lifetimes etc.!
   but basically, a function taking only & refs must be pure in the Haskell sense
   an `fn foo(&mut int)` can mutate the int, but nothing else
   etc.
 * Functions which do not have unique access to a Comm may not have effects outside of the current task.
 * Functions which do not have unique access to an IO may not have effects outside of the current process.
QUESTION: do the last two need to be in the language def, or should it be left up to `std`?
QUESTION: should FFI (`extern` blocks) have any compiler-enforced restrictions (e.g. mandatory cap arguments)? (maybe lint?)
QUESTION: do we need to do anything special w.r.t. `static mut`?

fn main(IO) { ... }

pub struct UnsafeCell<T> { ... }
pub fn get<T>(self: &UnsafeCell<T>, cap: Mut) -> *mut T;


### Potential maximalism:
Hierarchy of capability traits:
  always move  | copy if unique access* | always copy
  if exactly 1 | if at least 1*

2*3=6?

e.g. static init trick would want always copy + at least 1
http://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1wvxcn/lazily_initialized_statics/cf61im5
(this would actually be valuable... make it seamless to work with these zero-cost "proofs") (could also impl this for `()`, the trivial "cap")
non-zero-sized types would want exactly 1
exclusive-access caps would want always move

interaction with hierarchy of capability *types* not always obvious
e.g. if FooCap is by-copy and FooCap::Super is by-move, does going from FooCap::Super to FooCap move or copy?


## Use cases

### debug_assert!(...EXPR...)
=> expands to something like: let expr = ref |&:| ...EXPR...; if !expr() { fail!() }
=> env must be immutable => EXPR must be pure
=> can't accidentally put side effecting code in debug_assert
=> yay!


### STM
pub struct STM<'a> { marker1: NoCopy, marker2: ContravariantLifetime<'a> /* like & and &mut */ }
impl Capability for STM { }
// no Super!! can't do STM ops as normal IO, only in atomic transactions!
// (iow STM is disjoint from the main hierarchy of caps)

pub struct STMCell<T> { ... }
impl<T> Sync for STMCell<T> { }
pub fn new<T>(val: T) -> STMCell<T>; // pretty sure we don't need a cap here
// and/or `pub fn alloc<T>(self: &out STMCell<T>) -> &out T;`
pub fn get<T: Copy>(self: &STMCell<T>, cap: STM) -> T;
pub fn set<T: Copy>(self: &STMCell<T>, val: T, cap: STM);
pub fn unwrap<T>(self: STMCell<T>) -> T;
// whether/how to allow borrowing/swapping of STMCells seems like a separate question
// but given that transactions can be restarted etc. it might not be sound?
// (but maybe we can generalize to Clone?)

thanks to lifetime elision we don't actually need to write STM<'a> anywhere :o)

pub fn atomically<T>(body: &Fn(STM) -> T, cap: Comm) -> T { ... }
`atomic! { ... }` -> `atomically(ref |&:| { ... })`
`body` only has access to immutable environment => must be pure...
...except passed an `STM` cap, so it can do STM ops. but not any other IO!
`body` implicitly has a higher-rank lifetime (via elision): for<'a> &Fn(STM<'a>) -> T
so the STM cap cannot escape (~ ST trick in Haskell)
(this is why we need `struct STM<'a>` instead of just `struct STM`)
it's beautiful


### Lazy<T>
(see main notes)
need to distinguish Lazy values where the thunk may do IO and where it may not
this probably just means requiring `Fn` and not `FnOnce` for the thunk body
then you can safely `eval()` an `&Lazy<T>` (modulo blackholing) & know that it's pure
so I think this works out too (w/ some trickiness unrelated to purity)
(alternately: could parameterize Lazy, thunk, and eval over a cap?)


### Can we generalize Cell from Copy to Clone?

`Cell` require a cap (`Mut`) for its methods
`Clone::clone()` takes `&self` as only argument
caps cannot be duplicated through shared references
therefore there is no possibility of the `clone()` calling back to one of the `Cell`'s methods
basically, `clone()` must be pure (cannot be otherwise) and `Cell`'s methods are impure
so it seems like this should be OK!


### FRP

pub struct EventStream<T> { listeners: Option<Weak<Listeners<T>>> }

pub struct EventGenerator<T> { listeners: Rc<Listeners<T>> }

type Listeners<T> = DList<Box<Fn(&T)>>

pub struct Variable<T> { value: Rc<T>, changes: EventStream<T> }

pub fn never<T>() -> EventStream<T> { EventStream { listeners: None } }

pub fn generator<T>() -> EventGenerator<T> { EventGenerator { listeners: box DList::new() } }

pub fn stream<T>(generator: &EventGenerator<T>) -> EventStream<T> { EventStream { listeners: Some(generator.listeners.downgrade()) } }

pub fn generate<T>(self: &mut EventGenerator<T>, event: &T) { for &f in self.listeners.iter() { f(event); } }

pub fn merge<T>(a: &EventStream<T>, b: &EventStream<T>) -> EventStream<T> {
    let gen = generator();
    for stream in [a, b] {
        if let Some(listeners) = stream.listeners.and_then(|weak| weak.upgrade()) {
            listeners.push(box |event| gen.generate(event));
        }
    }
    gen.stream()
}

pub fn map<A, B>(stream: &EventStream<A>, f: Box<Fn(&A) -> B>) -> EventStream<B> {
    let gen = generator();
    if let Some(listeners) = stream.listeners.and_then(|weak| weak.upgrade()) {
        listeners.push(box |event| gen.generate(&f(event)));
    }
    gen.stream()
}

pub fn react<T>(events: &EventStream<T>, action: Fn(&T, IO), cap: IO) { ... }

pub fn exec(actions: &EventStream<Box<Fn(IO)>>, cap: IO) { ... }

(maybe these could even be generic over a cap, or take an FnMut/FnOnce which can store a cap in its closure...)
(lots of subtleties about ownership etc. need to be worked out in the above... just a sketch)

anyway, point is that creating and manipulating event streams/generators, and generating events, doesn't require IO
it's only when *observing* these and reacting to them that it becomes necessary
other than by using react/exec there's no way to "see" what's inside an EventStream/Variable, you can only manipulate them as black boxes

purity lets us separate manipulating-effectful-closures from invoking-effectful-closures in the types, just like Haskell
basically Haskell's `a -> b` is our `&Fn(&A) -> B`, and their `IO a` is our `&Fn(IO) -> T` (except `Gc` instead of `&`, but w/e)


### Misc

if `File::open()` takes an `IO` cap and stores it in the `File`, but does not expose it, and the methods do not take `IO` caps, then:

    fn frob_file(&mut File);

can be known to potentially do I/O on the given file, but _nothing else_!


### Parallelization
...what do we actually need to ensure / want to do here?
maybe we just want the same API as Niko's lightweight parallelism plans, and get the "parallel closures don't do IO" guarantee for free?
TODO


### Rewrite rules
need to read up more on the theoretical basis for soundness of rules
is this related to free theorems?
suspicion: Haskell only has pure functions, closures and thunks (immutable environments)...
...therefore rewrite rules should be sound for at least the subset of Rust code which only involves these things
need to think harder once pass-by-move and &mut things get involved

example: map() taking an &mut FnMut closure
in Haskell map f . map g = map (f . g)
but if f and g can have effects, then doing this would change their order
(instead of gggfff, gfgfgf)
so this would NOT be okay
have a separate &Fn version which is safe to fuse?
or let rewrite rules match types / traits in a fine-grained enough way...
...so that they only fire for the existing map(&mut FnMut) when the closure type is known to also impl Fn?
this doesn't work for existentials (trait objects, boxed closures)
except maybe with prodiguous inlining
but could work for unboxed closures











OLDER:
 - Proposal:
   have a zero-sized linear type `IO`
   any fn with (potentially-)globally observable effect must take `IO` as argument
     this includes `Cell` and `RefCell`
   main() gets passed an `IO`
   there is an implicit or explicit `dup_io(&mut IO) -> IO` mechanism
     also an `unsafe fn unsafe_io() -> IO` or similar, like Haskell's `unsafePerformIO`
     maintaining purity is the burden of the programmer
     (Rust has much better support for mutation inside pure functions than Haskell: how often would this still be necessary?)
   therefore, `fn` and `trait Fn`, if they do not take `IO` as argument, can only be pure
   `FnMut` and `FnOnce` can do IO by capturing `IO` in their closures
     HOFs "just work"
     a pure fn taking an `FnMut` closure may have exactly the effects of the closure
     -> effect polymorphism "for free" (?)
   potentially have a system for sub-effects, e.g. `io_to_comm(IO) -> Comm`, but *not* `comm_to_io(Comm) -> IO`
     then you can spawn a task which may only do intra-process communication, but no external IO
     Cell/RefCell could take `Mem`? or `Task`?
       what's the use case for this though?
       do you ever have `Task` but not `Comm`?
       (starting a task which can't have any external effect is pointless)
     essentially visibility scopes?
       this function (pure functions: handled by lifetimes)
       this task     (Cell/RefCell: struct Task?)
       this process  (inter-task communication: struct Comm?)
       whole world   (general input/output: struct IO?)
       i.o.w.: an Environment? Task, Process, World?
   language support would only be necessary to provide sugar
     BIG QUESTIONS how would this work?
     two areas:
       in `fn` signatures (also closures?)
       when calling `fn`s and closures
       (the latter is more important!)
     would these be tied together, or independent?
       can you call a with-sugar-declared fn without sugar?
       can you call a without-sugar-declared fn with sugar?
     generically for various effects, or just IO?
       generic would be nice
       but how does the compiler know you can get `Comm` from `IO`?
       use Coercible?
     is this kinda related to ImplicitParams in GHC?
       infer the argument from the available bindings in the environment
       just like with Overlapping/IncoherentInstances:
         choose one arbitrarily _only_ if the type is empty (contractible:) and it makes no difference
         if it has any members, there must be exactly one available option
         handle "subeffects" by taking automatic coercions into consideration?
         generalized, this is a unification of Haskell type classes and Scala implicits?!
         (IO & friends are runtime, instances/impls are compile time)
     keywords: maybe `use`? `effect`? `do`? `does`?
       needs to work for both top-level `fn` decls and closure types
.

















EVEN OLDER:
 - Clean does this
 - Rust already has linear types
 - `type io`, `sizeof::<io>() == 0`
 - fn print(io: io, s: &str) -> io;
   - GHC's IO monad is exactly this
 - The borrow checker also helps:
 - fn print(io: &mut io, s: &str):
 - `sizeof::<&mut io>() != 0`!!
 - just define io => &mut (old) io?
   allow `&mut World` with sizeof > 0
   but also provide monomorphic World-borrowing type with sizeof = 0
   borrowing means can't send between tasks!
   but can still do IO threads vs. non-IO threads
 - interpretation: "~pointer or &mut pointer to outside world"
   - but we don't actually need to enforce unique access for safety?
     - enough if `io` is copyable, just not constructible?
     - (`static mut` is unsafe anyways?) is this sufficient? can smuggling be outlawed?
     - does a linear type actually help to outlaw smuggling?
   - what other manipulations would this allow?
     - split into e.g. io_file, io_gui like Clean?
       - doesn't seem so principled... (but it works for Clean?)
       - resembles e.g. MonadFile, MonadGui in Haskell... is there a correspondence?
       - unnecessary if `io` is copyable? (but helpful?)
 - do you ever want to store `io` in a data structure?
 - any way to make the parameter passing implicit? (== state monad? reader monad?)
 - what about tasks??
   - (a) discard sequential ordering of effects, just care about purity
     - `io: !Send` ?!
     - does `io` even need to be linear in this case?!
     - defined order of effects is trivial under strict evaluation?
     - but not with tasks
   - (b) enforce sequential ordering, only one task does I/O at a time, pass capability around
 - use effect typing when monomorphic, explicit argument passing when poly?
 - USE CASES:
   - how does this let us say "only pure functions allowed"?
     - fn sort_by<T>(arr: &mut [T], cmp: fn(&T, &T) -> Ordering)
     - cmp doesn't have an `io` parameter, therefore pure
       - what if T is e.g. (int, io)? 
   - how does this let us abstract over pure and impure functions?
     - fn mapM<T, U, Env>(x: &[T], env: Env, f: fn(&T, Env) -> (U, Env)) -> (Env, ~[U])
       - Env is either () or `io` (or other things?)
     - OK: now can we do it nicer?
     - fn mapM<T, U, Env>(x: &[T], env: "&mut Env", f: fn(&T, "&mut Env") -> U) -> ~[U]
     - mapM -> map_with_env
     - is this nice enough?!  
 - could have functions like e.g. maybe_log(io: Option<io>)? (this is just Option<io>.map(log)?)
 - important part: extern functions (FFI). would need to model IO-ness accurately, like in Haskell.
 - how would(n't) this solve the "logging problem"?
 - problem: what if `io` is captured in a closure/trait object!!
   - less of a problem if `io` is linear... but still a problem?
   - `&Fn` couldn't do io
   - `FnMut`, `FnOnce`?!
   - special rules about using `io`/`io_cap` through &mut, &move?
 - need to ensure: `fn() -> int` doesn't side effect, just returns an int; `fn(io) -> int` can side effect
   - fn, fn mut, fn once/move distinction... fn io?
   - i.o.w. `io` can't be in a closure, need a different trait/method (but want?)
 - is all that's needed for IO primitives to require `io` as an arg, and for functions to not have access to anything besides their args?
 - in closures `&Fn` might still use Cell or something :-(
 - SOLUTION make Cell require io!
   - local effects are delimited by lifetimes, global ones require io
 - QUESTIONS `ST RealWorld` interpretation -> should IO be a lifetime?!
   ST is also based on `State# s`, which is a linear type
   basically this means we could make `&mut 's` POD if we had a separate linear `State 's` type required to use it?
      seems to satisfy the "only one of them is live at any given time" requirement... ?
   how does this relate to `static mut`?
   does it allow `RefCell` without the runtime borrow check?!
     how exactly... ?
     would this defeat the purpose?
     IORef is equivalent to Cell, not RefCell, Haskell doesn't have borrowing
   is 'io equivalent to 'static?!
   ----
   is `&mut 'static World` the type we're looking for... ?
   `&World` means the world is immutable -> this corresponds to pure functions!
   no it doesn't! it means you can read from it, but not one can write!
     but the World can change spontaneously, so the best you can do is &const/&volatile
     so maybe this doesn't make sense / isn't worth having
     but this is also true of `&mut`!!! rest-of-world can still do stuff
     is there an interpretation where we don't care... ?
 - QUESTION [how] should sugar be done for HOFs?
 - should have at least one thing that depends on purity for correctness, so people can ask "would this break _?" for unsafe code
 - ACID TEST: lazy evaluation (suspend()?)
   - is it OK to allow general lazy eval if we have purity?
   - fn new_gc<T>(x: lazy T) -> Gc<T>?
   - but lazy ~= FnOnce, and once fns can capture `io` in their closures... ?
     - it's *`new_gc`* that would be pure!
     - but you can't tell that from looking at it as an expr...
   - fn new_gc<T>(x: OnceFn() -> T) -> Gc<T>
   - and what about bottoms
   - two variants: a pure Lazy that can be evaled in pure code, and an effectful one that can't?
     Fn / FnOnce
 - ACID TEST: STM
 - ACID TEST: rewrite rules
 - ACID TEST: free theorems
    forall f g. fmap f . fmap g = fmap (f . g)
    fmap id = id
 - ACID TEST: automatic parallelization?
 - should `FnMut` / `FnOnce` closures be able to do IO by storing `World` in their closures?
   does allowing it mean that we get `mapM` etc. "for free"?
     test case: STM
       STM wants *neither* mutation of external things, nor IO
       so this would seem to point in that direction
       but what would an STM computation actually look like?
       what if: there's an affine `struct STM` alongside `IO`, which can only be accessed in STM transactions?
       so: `fn atomically<T>(transaction: &Fn(STM) -> T) -> T`?
       how to prevent the `STM` from leaking out? use a lifetime?
         is this still as general as STM in Haskell?
         if we say `struct STM<T>(for<'s> &Fn(STM_Cap<'s>) -> T)`, is that ~ Haskell's `data STM a`?
           in Haskell you never see the STM_Cap, so maybe?
       so: `fn atomically<T>(io_cap: IO_Cap, transaction: for<'s> &Fn(STM_Cap<'s>) -> T) -> T`?
       could also have a `Comm_Cap` for intra-process communication
         implied by IO_Cap, unlike STM_Cap
         then you can have can communicate but don't do any external IO
       how far can sugar for this be generalized? is it still simpler than effect typing?
     what about laziness, rewrite rules, free theorems?
     we still want "&mut 's FnMut only affects state inside 's"?
      for the case of calling `&mut FnMut` inside `&Fn`, it still works, because `&Fn` doesn't have IO access to pass on
          this hints at beautiful compositionality... ?
     do we want to be able to say `~FnMut` / `OnceFn` can't do IO?
       it can only do IO if nobody else can... ?
       is this enough?
         well it means no one else can observe you doing the IO, so...
       if following the `&mut World` model, `~FnMut` can only store it if `~FnMut:'s`, which reduces to the same thing
       does `main()` get `&mut World` or `&mut 'static World`??
       &mut 'static == &move 'static
     what if we want ~FnMut that _can_ do IO??
       doesn't work so well with the World-borrowing idea...
       what then is the difference between `&mut FnMut()` and `&mut FnMut(IO_Cap)`?
     our options:
       1. `#no_copy struct IO_Cap;`
          totally linear, can only be passed explicitly or in `FnOnce`
       2. `#no_copy struct IO_Cap<'s>; fn borrow_io_cap<'s>(&'s mut IO_Cap) -> IO_Cap<'s>;`
          can also be used in `&mut FnMut`
          also enforces linearity?
       3. `#no_copy struct IO_Cap; fn dup_io_cap(&mut IO_Cap) -> IO_Cap;`
          can also be used in `~FnMut`
          doesn't enforce linearity, just that &Fn can't use it
      probably go for 3. unless there's a compelling reason against
   if not, how to prevent it?
     (should World be borrowable at all?)
 - a closure is pure if it can only access an immutable environment
   can apply the same logic to exprs: (they are like unboxed closures)
     e.g. expr argument of assert!() can only borrow immutably, therefore can't have effects that might be erased
 - Rust equivalent of Haskell's:
   `IO a`   ->
   `ST s a` ->
   `STM a`  ->

fn fmap<F: Functor, A, B>(self: F<A>, f: &Fn(A) -> B) -> F<B>
fn id<T>(x: T) -> T
x.fmap(id) = id(x)
x.fmap(g).fmap(f) = x.fmap(comp(f, g))
