## Purity for (almost) free
 - requires changing very little
 - the goal is only to know what functions _can't_ do
 - what we choose to require is that bare functions and closures with immutable environments can't do IO without having an IO permission passed in
 - we achieve this by passing around IO capabilities/permissions, which can only be duplicated given unique/mutable access
 - in other words IO caps can be passed either by-move or (implicitly) cloned from &mut borrows, but are neither Copy nor Clone
   - need to be careful that `static mut`s don't allow any way to subvert it!
 - philosophical justification:
   TODO! consider the general case (not just closures but &mut references and existential quantification, private types, etc. in general)
   (but feels like it should be fine)
   - Haskell doesn't _have_ anything other than closures with immutable environments
   - => therefore, even if only those are pure in Rust, then we're at least as good as Haskell
   - GHC's IO monad is just `State# RealWorld -> (# State# RealWorld, a #)`
     or without the noise: `World -> (World, a)`
     State#/World must be used linearly, but GHC can't enforce it, so needs to hide it behind an `IO` monad
   - => but Rust does have linear/affine types!
   - Clean also has linear/affine/uniqueness types, so exposes World directly
     `World` is linear/affine because Haskell and Clean are lazily evaluated and need to enforce an execution order for IO
   - => but Rust is strictly evaluated, so there's no need for this! (it's free)
   - in Clean and Haskell, State#/World has two purposes:
     * enforce an execution order, and
     * make sure you can only do IO if you have the State#/World
   - => in Rust, we only need the latter
   - => therefore: `State`/`World`/`IO`/whatever is cloneable given unique access
   - can think of it as `&mut RealWorld`, i.e. a mutable reference to the outside world
   - normally `&mut T` is non-cloneable, to enforce unique access to the referent
   - but having unique access to the Outside World is by definition impossible!
   - => therefore, allowing the IO cap to be cloneable under `&mut` is OK!
 - the type system does not have to change at all
 - no effect typing, no polymorphism, just passing around IO caps in arguments
 - could do it entirely in library code, except for sugar
 - all closures with mutable environments are untouched
 - all function calls are untouched
 - only "top-level" functions which actually do IO need to be changed to take an IO cap
   - immutable closures, trait objects, and `fn` pointers need to take an `IO` cap, if they do IO
   - how many of these are there?
 - Cell, RefCell, and other "internal mutability" things need to take IO caps for their methods
   - QUESTION! if Cell takes IO cap in constructor and stores it instead, is that bad? why?
   - ANSWER! even if stored, couldn't use it from an & borrow!
 - traits are also mostly untouched, or improved
 - e.g. Eq and Ord _shouldn't_ do IO
 - for Iterator, iterators which do IO can store the IO cap, and next() takes &mut self so they can use it
 - types like Reader and Writer could either take an IO cap in their constructors and store it, or take an IO cap on each method
   - if the destructor does IO, they probably need to take it in the constructor and store it?
 - main() gets passed an IO cap
 - and of course `unsafe fn unsafe_io() -> IO` (...have `unsafe static`?)
 - the only hard part is figuring out sugar for implicitly passing (&mut-cloning) the IO cap, and/or whether to implement it as some kind of general mechanism
   - type-based? (declare that `struct IO` is always passed implicitly)
   - function-based? (allow declaring function args which are passed implicitly)
     - like GHC's ImplicitParams?
     - or search the calling context, pass implicitly if exactly 1 value of matching type is in scope, or if at least 1 is && type is zero-sized?
     - (like Scala implicits ... ?)
   - just hard-wire it?
     - => probably the wisest choice for now?
     - still need to figure out syntax 
       - `fn print(s: &str, use IO);`
         - `fn print_with(s: &str, printer: fn(&str, use IO))`
       - `fn print(s: &str) effect IO;`
         - `fn print_with(s: &str, printer: fn(&str) effect IO)`
       - `fn print(s: &str) do IO;`
         - `fn print_with(s: &str, printer: fn(&str) do IO)`
       - `fn print(s: &str) does IO;`
         - `fn print_with(s: &str, printer: fn(&str) does IO)`
   - CONSTRAINT: Should work for closures i.e. trait objects in general! (&mut FnMut...)
   - CONSTRAINT: Should also work for e.g. STM cap?
   - type-based is the only one which obviously satisfies these?
   - impl Env/Capability/... for IO/STM/... { }?
     - built-in trait
     - have a method `dup(&mut self) -> Self`? or `dup(self) -> (Self, Self)`?
     - `&mut` entails `let mut`, `&uniq` would be more appropriate
     - the second version also only works with `let mut` or if you make new `let`s each time...
     - but alternative is just compiler magic (which is involved anyway)
     - so then: &Fn(int, IO)? or special syntax? what/how?
 - and potentially extending it to a hierarchy of caps:
   - effects observable only:
     * within this function (trivial, default)
     * within this task: {Ref,}Cell
     * within this process: Arc, Atomic, spawn(), channel()
     * the whole "outside world": IO
   - allows e.g. starting tasks which cannot do external IO, only internal communication
   - would require a system for implicitly translating caps to sub-caps (explicitly would be too painful, e.g. have IO, want to use Cell)
     - impl SubCapOf<IO> for Comm?
     - this doesn't actually seem that bad, if it works
   - how much do we want this? Haskell only has IO.
   - => it's probably simpler to just have IO.
        could the others be added backwards-compatibly?
 TODO need to work through various use cases! 
  * debug_assert!()
  * Lazy<T>
  * STM
  * rewrite rules
  * parallelization?
 to see if all of this is truly sufficient.
 "Ask not what you can do for purity, but what purity can do for you"
 QUESTION would this also help with e.g. "cleanness" of pattern matching via `Deref`*? 
   definitely for plain `Deref`, maybe less so for `DerefMut`
 Q: "But what about logging?!"
 A: "Just pass in a (reference to) the logger!" (you should do this anyways)
 Q: "What about random number generation?"
 A: probably the same thing. boohoo.
 "purity" just devolves to not being able to access global mutable state?

### ACTUAL PROPOSAL:

#[lang(capability)]
pub trait Capability: sizeof(Self) = 0 {
    type Super: Capability = Self;
}

// magical wired-in:
pub fn dup<Cap: Capability>(cap: &uniq Cap)        -> Cap;
pub fn sub<Cap: Capability>(sup: &uniq Cap::Super) -> Cap;

// actually exposed:
pub fn {dup, sub} as above, except: &mut Cap, or Cap -> (Cap, Cap)

LANGUAGE DEF:
Whenever 
 * A function expects an argument of type `Cap` where `Cap: Capability` as its last argument, and
 * The argument is omitted by the caller, then:
 * If a value of type `Cap` is available in the caller's context, it is implicitly `dup()`ed, or
 * If a value of type `Cap::Super` is available, then it is implicitly `sub()`ed,
 * Then the result is implicitly passed in place of the omitted argument.

pub unsafe fn unsafe_cap<Cap: Capability>() -> Cap;

pub struct Mut  { priv marker: NonCopy }
pub struct Comm { priv marker: NonCopy }
pub struct IO   { priv marker: NonCopy }

impl Capability for Mut  { type Super = Comm; }
impl Capability for Comm { type Super = IO;   }
impl Capability for IO   {                    }

// LANGUAGE DEF:
 * Functions which do not have unique access to any Cap must be referentially transparent.
   TODO make this precise w.r.t &, &mut, etc.!
 * Functions which do not have unique access to a Comm may not have effects outside of the current task.
 * Functions which do not have unique access to an IO may not have effects outside of the current process.
QUESTION: do the last two need to be in the language def, or can it be left up to `std`?
QUESTION: should FFI (`extern` blocks) have any compiler-enforced restrictions?
QUESTION: do we need to do anything special w.r.t. `static mut`?

fn main(IO) { ... }

pub struct UnsafeCell<T> { ... }
pub fn unsafe_get_mut<T>(cell: &UnsafeCell<T>, Mut) -> *mut T;
























OLDER:
 - Proposal:
   have a zero-sized linear type `IO`
   any fn with (potentially-)globally observable effect must take `IO` as argument
     this includes `Cell` and `RefCell`
   main() gets passed an `IO`
   there is an implicit or explicit `dup_io(&mut IO) -> IO` mechanism
     also an `unsafe fn unsafe_io() -> IO` or similar, like Haskell's `unsafePerformIO`
     maintaining purity is the burden of the programmer
     (Rust has much better support for mutation inside pure functions than Haskell: how often would this still be necessary?)
   therefore, `fn` and `trait Fn`, if they do not take `IO` as argument, can only be pure
   `FnMut` and `FnOnce` can do IO by capturing `IO` in their closures
     HOFs "just work"
     a pure fn taking an `FnMut` closure may have exactly the effects of the closure
     -> effect polymorphism "for free" (?)
   potentially have a system for sub-effects, e.g. `io_to_comm(IO) -> Comm`, but *not* `comm_to_io(Comm) -> IO`
     then you can spawn a task which may only do intra-process communication, but no external IO
     Cell/RefCell could take `Mem`? or `Task`?
       what's the use case for this though?
       do you ever have `Task` but not `Comm`?
       (starting a task which can't have any external effect is pointless)
     essentially visibility scopes?
       this function (pure functions: handled by lifetimes)
       this task     (Cell/RefCell: struct Task?)
       this process  (inter-task communication: struct Comm?)
       whole world   (general input/output: struct IO?)
       i.o.w.: an Environment? Task, Process, World?
   language support would only be necessary to provide sugar
     BIG QUESTIONS how would this work?
     two areas:
       in `fn` signatures (also closures?)
       when calling `fn`s and closures
       (the latter is more important!)
     would these be tied together, or independent?
       can you call a with-sugar-declared fn without sugar?
       can you call a without-sugar-declared fn with sugar?
     generically for various effects, or just IO?
       generic would be nice
       but how does the compiler know you can get `Comm` from `IO`?
       use Coercible?
     is this kinda related to ImplicitParams in GHC?
       infer the argument from the available bindings in the environment
       just like with Overlapping/IncoherentInstances:
         choose one arbitrarily _only_ if the type is empty (contractible:) and it makes no difference
         if it has any members, there must be exactly one available option
         handle "subeffects" by taking automatic coercions into consideration?
         generalized, this is a unification of Haskell type classes and Scala implicits?!
         (IO & friends are runtime, instances/impls are compile time)
     keywords: maybe `use`? `effect`? `do`? `does`?
       needs to work for both top-level `fn` decls and closure types
.

















EVEN OLDER:
 - Clean does this
 - Rust already has linear types
 - `type io`, `sizeof::<io>() == 0`
 - fn print(io: io, s: &str) -> io;
   - GHC's IO monad is exactly this
 - The borrow checker also helps:
 - fn print(io: &mut io, s: &str):
 - `sizeof::<&mut io>() != 0`!!
 - just define io => &mut (old) io?
   allow `&mut World` with sizeof > 0
   but also provide monomorphic World-borrowing type with sizeof = 0
   borrowing means can't send between tasks!
   but can still do IO threads vs. non-IO threads
 - interpretation: "~pointer or &mut pointer to outside world"
   - but we don't actually need to enforce unique access for safety?
     - enough if `io` is copyable, just not constructible?
     - (`static mut` is unsafe anyways?) is this sufficient? can smuggling be outlawed?
     - does a linear type actually help to outlaw smuggling?
   - what other manipulations would this allow?
     - split into e.g. io_file, io_gui like Clean?
       - doesn't seem so principled... (but it works for Clean?)
       - resembles e.g. MonadFile, MonadGui in Haskell... is there a correspondence?
       - unnecessary if `io` is copyable? (but helpful?)
 - do you ever want to store `io` in a data structure?
 - any way to make the parameter passing implicit? (== state monad? reader monad?)
 - what about tasks??
   - (a) discard sequential ordering of effects, just care about purity
     - `io: !Send` ?!
     - does `io` even need to be linear in this case?!
     - defined order of effects is trivial under strict evaluation?
     - but not with tasks
   - (b) enforce sequential ordering, only one task does I/O at a time, pass capability around
 - use effect typing when monomorphic, explicit argument passing when poly?
 - USE CASES:
   - how does this let us say "only pure functions allowed"?
     - fn sort_by<T>(arr: &mut [T], cmp: fn(&T, &T) -> Ordering)
     - cmp doesn't have an `io` parameter, therefore pure
       - what if T is e.g. (int, io)? 
   - how does this let us abstract over pure and impure functions?
     - fn mapM<T, U, Env>(x: &[T], env: Env, f: fn(&T, Env) -> (U, Env)) -> (Env, ~[U])
       - Env is either () or `io` (or other things?)
     - OK: now can we do it nicer?
     - fn mapM<T, U, Env>(x: &[T], env: "&mut Env", f: fn(&T, "&mut Env") -> U) -> ~[U]
     - mapM -> map_with_env
     - is this nice enough?!  
 - could have functions like e.g. maybe_log(io: Option<io>)? (this is just Option<io>.map(log)?)
 - important part: extern functions (FFI). would need to model IO-ness accurately, like in Haskell.
 - how would(n't) this solve the "logging problem"?
 - problem: what if `io` is captured in a closure/trait object!!
   - less of a problem if `io` is linear... but still a problem?
   - `&Fn` couldn't do io
   - `FnMut`, `FnOnce`?!
   - special rules about using `io`/`io_cap` through &mut, &move?
 - need to ensure: `fn() -> int` doesn't side effect, just returns an int; `fn(io) -> int` can side effect
   - fn, fn mut, fn once/move distinction... fn io?
   - i.o.w. `io` can't be in a closure, need a different trait/method (but want?)
 - is all that's needed for IO primitives to require `io` as an arg, and for functions to not have access to anything besides their args?
 - in closures `&Fn` might still use Cell or something :-(
 - SOLUTION make Cell require io!
   - local effects are delimited by lifetimes, global ones require io
 - QUESTIONS `ST RealWorld` interpretation -> should IO be a lifetime?!
   ST is also based on `State# s`, which is a linear type
   basically this means we could make `&mut 's` POD if we had a separate linear `State 's` type required to use it?
      seems to satisfy the "only one of them is live at any given time" requirement... ?
   how does this relate to `static mut`?
   does it allow `RefCell` without the runtime borrow check?!
     how exactly... ?
     would this defeat the purpose?
     IORef is equivalent to Cell, not RefCell, Haskell doesn't have borrowing
   is 'io equivalent to 'static?!
   ----
   is `&mut 'static World` the type we're looking for... ?
   `&World` means the world is immutable -> this corresponds to pure functions!
   no it doesn't! it means you can read from it, but not one can write!
     but the World can change spontaneously, so the best you can do is &const/&volatile
     so maybe this doesn't make sense / isn't worth having
     but this is also true of `&mut`!!! rest-of-world can still do stuff
     is there an interpretation where we don't care... ?
 - QUESTION [how] should sugar be done for HOFs?
 - should have at least one thing that depends on purity for correctness, so people can ask "would this break _?" for unsafe code
 - ACID TEST: lazy evaluation (suspend()?)
   - is it OK to allow general lazy eval if we have purity?
   - fn new_gc<T>(x: lazy T) -> Gc<T>?
   - but lazy ~= FnOnce, and once fns can capture `io` in their closures... ?
     - it's *`new_gc`* that would be pure!
     - but you can't tell that from looking at it as an expr...
   - fn new_gc<T>(x: OnceFn() -> T) -> Gc<T>
   - and what about bottoms
   - two variants: a pure Lazy that can be evaled in pure code, and an effectful one that can't?
     Fn / FnOnce
 - ACID TEST: STM
 - ACID TEST: rewrite rules
 - ACID TEST: free theorems
    forall f g. fmap f . fmap g = fmap (f . g)
    fmap id = id
 - ACID TEST: automatic parallelization?
 - should `FnMut` / `FnOnce` closures be able to do IO by storing `World` in their closures?
   does allowing it mean that we get `mapM` etc. "for free"?
     test case: STM
       STM wants *neither* mutation of external things, nor IO
       so this would seem to point in that direction
       but what would an STM computation actually look like?
       what if: there's an affine `struct STM` alongside `IO`, which can only be accessed in STM transactions?
       so: `fn atomically<T>(transaction: &Fn(STM) -> T) -> T`?
       how to prevent the `STM` from leaking out? use a lifetime?
         is this still as general as STM in Haskell?
         if we say `struct STM<T>(for<'s> &Fn(STM_Cap<'s>) -> T)`, is that ~ Haskell's `data STM a`?
           in Haskell you never see the STM_Cap, so maybe?
       so: `fn atomically<T>(io_cap: IO_Cap, transaction: for<'s> &Fn(STM_Cap<'s>) -> T) -> T`?
       could also have a `Comm_Cap` for intra-process communication
         implied by IO_Cap, unlike STM_Cap
         then you can have can communicate but don't do any external IO
       how far can sugar for this be generalized? is it still simpler than effect typing?
     what about laziness, rewrite rules, free theorems?
     we still want "&mut 's FnMut only affects state inside 's"?
      for the case of calling `&mut FnMut` inside `&Fn`, it still works, because `&Fn` doesn't have IO access to pass on
          this hints at beautiful compositionality... ?
     do we want to be able to say `~FnMut` / `OnceFn` can't do IO?
       it can only do IO if nobody else can... ?
       is this enough?
         well it means no one else can observe you doing the IO, so...
       if following the `&mut World` model, `~FnMut` can only store it if `~FnMut:'s`, which reduces to the same thing
       does `main()` get `&mut World` or `&mut 'static World`??
       &mut 'static == &move 'static
     what if we want ~FnMut that _can_ do IO??
       doesn't work so well with the World-borrowing idea...
       what then is the difference between `&mut FnMut()` and `&mut FnMut(IO_Cap)`?
     our options:
       1. `#no_copy struct IO_Cap;`
          totally linear, can only be passed explicitly or in `FnOnce`
       2. `#no_copy struct IO_Cap<'s>; fn borrow_io_cap<'s>(&'s mut IO_Cap) -> IO_Cap<'s>;`
          can also be used in `&mut FnMut`
          also enforces linearity?
       3. `#no_copy struct IO_Cap; fn dup_io_cap(&mut IO_Cap) -> IO_Cap;`
          can also be used in `~FnMut`
          doesn't enforce linearity, just that &Fn can't use it
      probably go for 3. unless there's a compelling reason against
   if not, how to prevent it?
     (should World be borrowable at all?)
 - a closure is pure if it can only access an immutable environment
   can apply the same logic to exprs: (they are like unboxed closures)
     e.g. expr argument of assert!() can only borrow immutably, therefore can't have effects that might be erased
 - Rust equivalent of Haskell's:
   `IO a`   ->
   `ST s a` ->
   `STM a`  ->

fn fmap<F: Functor, A, B>(self: F<A>, f: &Fn(A) -> B) -> F<B>
fn id<T>(x: T) -> T
x.fmap(id) = id(x)
x.fmap(g).fmap(f) = x.fmap(comp(f, g))
