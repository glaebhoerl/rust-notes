Deconflate types and modules

No types in paths
  instead of `Vec::new()`, write `vec()` or `new_vec()`

Types and modules live in separate namespaces

Remove Self and self
  traits are now `trait Ord<T> { fn cmp(a: &T, b: &T) -> Ordering; }`
  QUESTION should we do this? having it clear which type is Self instead of arbitrarily first/last is nice...

Trait type parameters always input types, output types always associated types
  already part of aturon's RFC :)

Remove anonymous impls
  use `for<T>` and typedefs instead, if wanted

trait methods and associated items live in parent scope
  do they get imported together with the trait? (what about enum variants?)
    no, they shouldn't: they're no different from any other polymorphic `fn` (?)
    what about in `impl`s? do all methods have to be in scope to write an `impl`?
    allow restricted globs a la Haskell, like `use foo::Trait { .. }` to import all methods?

`trait Foo<T> { type Assoc; fn func(); static NUM: int; }` adds T as a type parameter to each item (at beginning or end? prob beginning?)
    Assoc<Type>, func::<Type>(), NUM::<Type>
    works exactly the same as `for<T>`

trait impls are now e.g. `impl Ord<MyType> { }` or `for<T: Ord> impl PartialOrd<T> { }` (or impl<T: Ord> PartialOrd<T>)
    remove `impl for` syntax
    means you can grep for `impl Trait`

What about trait objects, Trait + Trait, ... ?

UFCS

UMCS
  on what basis?
  search first in caller's scope, then in module where type was *imported from*
  or some kind of `use mod::{Type { .. }, foo, ...}` syntax?
  but then should we put anonymous `impl`s back again?
  

Benefits:
  Massively simplify resolve!
  Simplicity, consistency, orthogonality
  Name resolution comes before typechecking
  UMCS
  Removes need for "helper traits" and extraneous default methods (simplifies e.g. Iterator)
  Obviates UFCS debate
  Obviates Trait::foo vs Type::foo vs <Type as Trait>::foo debate
  80% of Rust code is shifted 4 lines leftwards
  (?) `impl Trait` greppability

FUTURE:

- mod<T>?
 - types and modules are distinct, but can parameterize each over the other?? (== just different kinds?)
 - mod m<type T> { static x: T } makes sense(?)
 - but struct T<mod m> { x: m::some_type } not so much? traits on mods??
   - trait Foo<mod m> { static N: uint; fn foo(); type T; ... mod sub;??? }
   - ok, but what about bounds and impls?
     - mod my_mod<mod param_mod: Foo> {
           use param_mod::N;
       }
     - impl Foo<foo_mod> {
           ...
       }
 - if we ever grow ML-style module signatures, we should find a way to make `trait`s serve dual purposes
   - would you be required to write `impl Trait for my_mod`, or would it be implicit?
   - (need to investigate how ML works...)
   - module = input type, Self = output type?!
